# Tetris Project

This is a Tetris game built using Java and the NetBeans IDE. The game follows the classic Tetris gameplay, where the player has to rotate and move different shapes of blocks falling from the top of the screen to complete horizontal lines without leaving any gaps.

## Getting Started
To play the game, you need to clone this repository to your local machine and then import the project into NetBeans IDE. Once you have imported the project, you can run the game by executing the Game.java file.
